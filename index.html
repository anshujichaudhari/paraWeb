    <h2>About Gateway of India</h2>
    <p>
      The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was erected
      to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.

      Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The
      structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in
      1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic
      ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay. It served to allow entry and access to
      India.

    <h2>About Hawa Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building
      looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas.
      This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally
      translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.


      The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court
      to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen
      themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been
      built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape
      which has helped it stay erect for centuries.


      The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building resembles the crown of
      Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural marvel that reflects a truly
      harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles. The Rajput style can be seen
      in the domes canopies and the fluted pillars, while the stone inlay filigree work and the arches are perfect
      depictions of the Mughal style of architecture.
